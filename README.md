Features

Login - Users have the ability to login to the website through the Google Plus Login API (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/plus.login). 

New Question - A question can be created with or without logging in.  Users have the option of answering a question with the Pro/Con Method or by simply listing their options and using their intuition to decide (Intuition Method).

Advice - Using the Google Contacts API (https://www.googleapis.com/auth/contacts.readonly), users have the ability to search for a contact in their gmail Contacts List.  If a contact is found, the contactâ€™s name and email populate the table heading below. By adding the contact to the body of the table and clicking on the send icon, the user can send an email to the contact using the mailto feature, which pre-populates an email in your mail client.  Your contact can click on the link in their email to easily submit their opinion without logging into the website.  You can view their opinion on the Decision page of the website.  

History - The History page lists all Decisions that the user has created.  Clicking on a decision will bring you to the Decision page where you can view the submitted opinions of each of your advisors.
